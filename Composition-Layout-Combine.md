## Objectives 

* Use all we've learnt so far to build a photo search application in a custom layout. 
* Use the `Combine` framework to make asynchronous network requests via a `Publisher` and `Subscriber`. 
* Use `UISearchController` along with the `debounce` Combine operator to prevent multiple network requests from the search bar.
